# ðŸš¦ Beginner Traffic Light Controller

This is a beginner-level Python mini-project that simulates a traffic light system.

---

## How It Works

- RED â†’ Wait 3 seconds
- YELLOW â†’ Wait 2 seconds
- GREEN â†’ Wait 3 seconds
- Then prints "Traffic light cycle complete!"

This simulation only runs **one cycle** (no loops or advanced logic), so it's perfect for beginners.

---

## ðŸ“„ Python Code

```python
import time

print("RED - STOP")
time.sleep(3)

print("YELLOW - SLOW DOWN")
time.sleep(2)

print("GREEN - GO")
time.sleep(3)

print("Traffic light cycle complete!")
```
